# Online Boutique Demo Applications

[Online Boutique](https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/microservices-demo) is a cloud-native microservices demo application. Online Boutique consists of a 10-tier microservices application. The application is a web-based e-commerce app where users can browse items, add them to the cart, and purchase them.

Google uses this application to demonstrate use of technologies like Kubernetes/GKE, Istio, Stackdriver, gRPC and OpenCensus. This application works on any Kubernetes cluster (such as a local one), as well as Google Kubernetes Engine. Itâ€™s easy to deploy with little to no configuration.
